  <p>The installed capacity, multiplied for the number of hours that a power plan is working, will give the amount of electricity (in Wh) generated in one year.
Every technology has a different lifetime (see background table), so we take this into account to calculate the total impact of the investment, over the whole period of operation. For example, an hydropower plant is in operation for 50 years on average, while a wind mill for 25 years. Data is taken from IPCC.</p>
