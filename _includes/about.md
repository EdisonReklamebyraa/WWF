## ABOUT

WWF is the world’s leading independent conservation organization, working in more than 100 countries in 6 continents. Over 5 million people support our work. 
Our mission is to build a future in which people live in harmony with nature. 
We're striving to safeguard the natural world, helping people live more sustainably and take action against climate change. 

WWF works worldwide to promote solutions, and renewable energy is one of these. 
WWF-Norway is asking the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund - the world’s largest with over USD 850 billion - to invest at least 5% in renewable energy infrastructure.
