<h2 id="about">ABOUT</h2>

<p>WWF is the world’s leading independent conservation organization, working in more than 100 countries in 6 continents. Over 5 million people support our work.
  Our mission is to build a future in which people live in harmony with nature.
  We’re striving to safeguard the natural world, helping people live more sustainably and take action against climate change. </p>
<p>WWF works worldwide to promote solutions, and renewable energy is one of these.
  WWF-Norway is asking the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund - the world’s largest with over USD 850 billion - to invest at least 5% in renewable energy infrastructure. </p>
