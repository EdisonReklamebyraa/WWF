    <p>“Five percent renewable energy investments in a two degrees world” has been published in October 2015, and presents a model and some hypothetical case studies in which large institutional investors (pension funds, sovereign wealth fund, etc) invest a given amount of money in renewable energy infrastructure: solar and wind farms, geothermal plants, bioenergy, hydropower, marine.</p>

    <p>The model uses the latest data from the most authoritative sources, such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p>

    <p>We recommend to read the report before using the more advanced features of the web-calculator, in order to fully understand the methodology and limitations of the model.</p>

    <p>Attached, you will find an infographic that presents the main results from the report.</p>
