## WWF-Norway’s report 

“Five percent renewable energy investments in a two degrees world” has been published in October 2015, and presents a model and some hypothetical case studies in which large institutional investors (pension funds, sovereign wealth fund, etc) invest a given amount of money in renewable energy infrastructure: solar and wind farms, geothermal plants, bioenergy, hydropower, marine.

The model uses the latest data from the most authoritative sources, such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

We recommend to read the report before using the more advanced features of the web-calculator, in order to fully understand the methodology and limitations of the model.

Attached, you will find an infographic that presents the main results from the report.
