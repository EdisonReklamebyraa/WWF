<h2 id="key-results-of-the-model-for-every-renewable-energy-technology">Key results (tables)</h2>

<p>The following tables shows the most relevant results of the table, in a numerical format.
<ul>For every renewable energy technology:
<li>Annual investment (USD): money invested every year in this specific technology.</li>
<li>Electricity output, annual (kWh): the electricity generated in one year based on the investment made.</li> 
<li>Electricity output, lifetime (kWh): the power plant built will last for a number of year, equal to the lifetime of the plant. For hydropower will typically be 50 years.</li>
<li>Installed capacity (kW): investment will finance new power plants which have a given capacity, which is the maximum electric output a generator can produce.</li>
<li>Share of investment: it indicates the share of investment channeled to a specific technology.</li></ul></p>

<p>Table 2 shows the total annual power generation due to the investments. The first year will be X, the second year will be X + Y, the third year will be X + Y + Zâ€¦and so on. The timeline is based on the lifetime of the technologies.
