<h2 id="welcome-to-wwf-norways-web-calculator-based-on-the-report-five-percent-renewable-energy-investments-in-a-two-degrees-world">Welcome to WWF-Norway’s web-calculator, based on the report “Five percent renewable energy investments in a two degrees world”.</h2>

<p>In this, we illustrate the potential impact of large investors - such as pension funds and sovereign wealth fund - investing in renewable energy infrastructure. 
  In the web-calculator, you can build your own case, choose how much money should be invested in a mix of renewable energy over a period of time, and get the following results:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installed capacity annual and total;</li>
  <li>Electricity generation, annual and total;</li>
  <li>Emission saved by not investing in fossil fuels instead;</li>
  <li>Rough estimate of the number of jobs created.</li>
</ul>

<p>All default background data is editable, for instance if you want to make your own scenario and invest only in one technology. You can save the changes you made. All graphs are downloadable. Enjoy!</p>
