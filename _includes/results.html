<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>This section provides a more comprehensive presentation of the results of your calculations, thanks to five pre-defined graphs. In addition, in the section called “Key results (tables)”, you will find all numbers in a table. This allows you to have a more detailed review as well as to develop other graphs of interest to you.</p>

<p>This graph shows how much money is invested annually (left bar) and how the investments build up to reach the target (right bar), that is <span class="targetPercent"></span>.</p>

<p>This graph visualizes the energy mix which is used to allocate the investment in every technology (based on the first year of the scenario). In short, the money invested every year are allocated to different technologies for the generation of renewable energy, according to this scheme. This default allocation is based on the International Energy Agency’s scenario for the investmed needed in the next years. Until 2020, the central scenario is used (New Policy Scenario), while after 2020 and until 2040 we chose the 450 scenario, which shows the path needed to limit global warming to 2-degrees Celsius. This is the goal that almost all countries in the world have agreed upon.</p>

<p>This graph shows how investments are allocated to the various renewable energy technologies. The default allocation or electricity mix is based on the IEA’s energy scenarios. The mix until 2020 is based on a central scenario (New Policy Scenario), while after 2020 and until 2035 it is based on the 450S scenario, which shows the path needed to limit global warming to 2-degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>This graph shows theoretically how much new capacity is installed every year: this means new solar panels and wind turbines, geothermal plants, hydropower dams, and so on. Electricity generation capacity indicates the maximum electric output a generator can produce.</p>

<hr />
<p>This graph shows the theoretical amount of electricity generated every year for the lifetime of the power plants. In fact, every technology has a different life-cycle (see background table). For example, a hydropower plant is in operation for 50 years, while a wind turbine for 25 years. Data on average lifetime is provided by  <a href="http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_Annex_II.pdf" target="_blank">IPCC</a>, and the user can edit it. This graph also lets you compare the annual electricity generation to a number of your choice. For example, youone can choose to compare it to the annual electricity generation of a country, or a city, or a power plant.</p>
