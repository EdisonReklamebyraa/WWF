  <p>To illustrate the potential effect on greenhouse gas emissions we ask the following question: What are the associated emissions if the electricity generated from the investment would have been generated by a mix of fossil fuels instead? The calculations are based on the emissions factors provided by <a href="http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_Annex_II.pdf" target="_blank">IPCC</a> (in grams CO2 equivalent/kWh). The results are based on life-cycle emissions generated by the power plants funded by the investor.
